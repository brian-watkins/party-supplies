# Spheres

Write browser-based web applications using 
- [@spheres/store](./packages/store/README.md) -- state management
that separates application logic from state storage details.
- [@spheres/view](./packages/view/README.md) -- a declarative view
framework that supports fine-grained reactive updates.

Check out the [examples](./examples/).

To get started with development, install all the dependencies:

```
$ npm install --workspaces
```
